# Suicide-Ideation-Detection-in-Social-Media-Using-Personality-Traits
This research investigates the relationship between personality traits and suicide ideation in social media and proposes three methods to detect suicide ideation using machine learning models: classification using text features only, classification using personality traits only, and classification using a combination of text features and personality traits. 
1. EDA_&_SID_using_text_only.ipynb includes the codes of text analysis & classification using text features only.
2. SID using personality only.ipynb includes the codes of personality correlation analysis & classification using personality traits only.
3. SID_using_text_and_personality_traits.ipynb includes the codes of classification using a combination of text features and personality traits.
